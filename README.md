# Flappy-Bird-Game 
A classic **Flappy Bird** clone built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is a tribute to the original game by Dong Nguyen and is fully playable in any modern web browser.

Flappy Bird is a simple side-scrolling game where you control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes by tapping or pressing a key to make the bird flap and stay airborne. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without crashing.
